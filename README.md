## For code or design contribution

We are pleased you are on this page and willing to contribute this platform to make it even better. 

### Developers: 
We use GitHub public repository to make this platform accessible to open source contributors. We hope to have at least one developer who is responsible for one country page and it’s related parties’ maintenance and required updates from political parties.

Figma is our design tool to keep everyone up to date with current design and discuss future design concepts. You are most welcome to share your design concepts with us.
