    <p class="platform-purpose">
      This platform is created to heal the relationship problem between citizens
      and politicians / political parties. Hopefully, this platform may help
      citizens and political parties to understand each other better.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>Goal I</h3>
    <p class="goal-text">
      Understanding each party's purpose. Most of the citizens can only name a
      few political parties however there are usually more than thier
      acknowlegde registered parties to vote on. Therefore, this platform aims
      to help citizens to get to know every single option when it comes to
      voting. Many people do not like politics and do not feel like voting for
      any party at all because they do not like the popular parties or do not
      know of the unpopular parties because of the media influence. Therefore,
      in this platform every party will be portrayed equally and hopefully,
      citizens will gain access to knowledge of not well-known parties as well.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Goal II</h3>
    <p class="goal-text">
      This platform also aims to find out what people think about each party,
      positively and negatively. Therefore we can see what parties good and bad
      at according to the citizens. Then we can easily compare parties, and
      politicians can also understand what citizens think about them in general.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Goal III</h3>
    <p class="goal-text">
      Eventually, this platform will also help citizens to express their ideas
      or desires from an imaginary political party, what to focus on, and what
      to avoid the most. Therefore, political parties can see what citizens care
      about the most and the least.
